     <h3>Spaceteam is the one game on this list that requires all your friends to be in the same physical space.</h3>

       
       <h1> In Spaceteam, you and your friends are the crew of a spaceship and everything's going wrong. </h1>
      <h2>  To stay on course, you'll need to work together by shouting different made-up space commands to each other.</h2>
        <h3> The speed and the chaos ramp up and up, until you all inevitably crash and die, only to be awarded medals posthumously.
         But it's fun while it lasts. </h3>
        
        <h1> If you have a smaller friend group, you can also try out the best two-player mobile games.
